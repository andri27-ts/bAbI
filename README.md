# Bubble

This repository contains a simple Question Answering algorithm developed in Tensorflow. 
We'll use the bAbI tasks 1-20, created by facebook, for testing the capacity of our algorithm for text understanding and reasoning.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

In order to run the notebook you need to install tensorflow and gym (included the atari games).

```
$ pip install tensorflow --upgrade
$ pip install tqdm
```

### Installing

Next, install [git](https://git-scm.com/) if you don't have already it and run the following commands on your terminal

```
$ cd $HOME  # or any other development directory you prefer
$ git clone 
$ cd 
```

## Tensorboard

To visualize the loss function and the histograms of the NN layers using Tensorboard, run on your terminal

```
$ cd $HOME  # or any other development directory you prefer
$ cd 
$ tensorboard --logdir tf_logs
```
